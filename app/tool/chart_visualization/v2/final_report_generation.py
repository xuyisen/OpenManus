# Replacing Type
1. Find all placeholders
2. When replacing the chart path placeholder, use a relative path. ** src="/workspace/visualization/chart_name.html" **
3. When replacing the text placeholders, generate a detailed text description.
   **When filling in the key insights below the charts, the insights must correspond with those previously added by the add insight tool.**

## Notice:
Use the absolute path starting with /workspace, for example, **/workspace/visualization/chart_name.html**

# Check_refine Type:
1. Check the entire html file
- Have all placeholders been filled?
- Whether the path of the chart is: /workspace/visualization/***.html
- If text-related placeholders still exist, please fill them in as much as possible. If chart path placeholders still exist, please delete that chart part of the report.
   **When filling in the key insights below the charts, the insights must correspond with those previously added by the add insight tool.**



## Output Requirements
1. Generate **report.html** file
2. Print the file path: print(report_path)
3. Make sure the HTML includes Bootstrap for responsive design
